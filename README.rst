==================
django-authorities
==================

An application for managing your organization's authorities (departments, directorates etc)

Example
=======

I've added an example project of using django-generic-scaffold: https://github.com/spapas/generic-scaffold-demo

Installation
============

Install it with ``pip install django-generic-scaffold``, or if you want to use the latest version on github, try ``pip install git+https://github.com/spapas/django-generic-scaffold``.

If you want to use the template tags and the fallback templates of django-generic-scaffold, please put ``generic_scaffold`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. If you
don't need the template tags or fallback templates then no modifying of your settings is needed, just go ahead and use it!

Simple usage
============



v.0.1.1
-------

- Add template tags to get crud urls

v.0.1.0
-------

- Initial version
